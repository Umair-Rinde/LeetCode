# 1. Two Sum

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Table
Companies: Multiple

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Important Points:

* Each input has exactly one solution.
* You may not use the same element twice.
* You can return the answer in any order.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]

Constraints:

* 2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴
* −10⁹ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹
* −10⁹ ≤ target ≤ 10⁹
* Only one valid answer exists.
